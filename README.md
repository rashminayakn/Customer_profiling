# Customer_profiling

The client requirement was to model customerâ€™s propensity to pay off the loan in a P2P lending corporation.
Preprocessed the data by checking for missing values and transforming features into appropriate form for modeling.
Used Random Forest to obtain the variable importance and performed feature selection.
Handled class imbalance using SMOTE technique.
Built Logistic Regression model and tuned threshold in ROC curve for binary prediction.
Performed Grid search CV to find optimal hyper parameters for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithm. 
Model evaluated using metrics: Precision and Recall.
